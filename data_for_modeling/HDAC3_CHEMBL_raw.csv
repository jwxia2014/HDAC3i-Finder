The tripeptide substrate and trypsin at 0.05 uM final concentration were diluted in assay buffer at 6 fold their final concentration. The final enzyme concentrations used in these assays were 3.3 ng/ml (HDAC1), 0.2 ng/ml (HDAC2), 0.08 ng/ml (HDAC3) and 2 ng/ml (HDAC6). The final substrate concentrations used were 16 uM (HDAC1), 10 uM (HDAC2), 17 uM (HDAC3) and 14 uM (HDAC6).

After the substrate was deacetylated by HDACs, the product AMC which was obtained from hydrolysis by trypsin can generate fluorescence signal. Measurement is taken in using an multilabe plate reader a 355 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter. The initial rate of fluorescence should accurately reflect the rate of product formation and enzyme activity. Sample processing: The sample was dissolved in DMSO and kept at a low temperature. DMSO in the final system is limited under a low concentration which won't affect the enzyme activity.",single protein format,CHEMBL1829,Histone deacetylase 3,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886429,BindingDB Database,0,0,340.43,18.1,0.38,4.18,5.91,1.98,Homo sapiens,,,,,9606,BAO_0000357,,,,,Cc1sc(nc1C(=O)NCCCCC(=O)NO)c2nccs2,,,2015,37,UO_0000065,FALSE

Substrate solution was prepared as follow: Boc(Lys-Ac)-AMC was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with HDAC buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 250 ??M EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) to give 1 mM solutions containing 1.7% DMSO. Trypsin was used to stop the reaction, releasing free AMC. The trypsin solution was prepared as follow: trypsin was dissolved in HDAC buffer to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 460 nm (lex=390 nm) with a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini) at 37? C. The AMC signals were recorded against a blank with buffer, substrate and trypsin but without the enzyme. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. For HDAC inhibition assays, inhibitor diluted in 50 ?L of HDAC buffer was mixed with 10 ?L of diluted enzyme solution in HDAC buffer at room temperature. The HDAC reaction was started by adding 40 ?L of substrate solution in HDAC buffer followed by 30 min of incubation with stirring at 37? C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?L, of trypsin solution. After a 10 min incubation with stirring at 37? C., the release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence.",single protein format,CHEMBL1829,Histone deacetylase 3,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886894,BindingDB Database,4,0,264.32,28.27,0.54,5,9.53,2.47,Homo sapiens,,,,,9606,BAO_0000357,,,,,ONC(=O)CCCCCCC(=O)Nc1ccccc1,,,2016,37,UO_0000065,FALSE
